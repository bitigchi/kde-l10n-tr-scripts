# Translation Tools

Translation tools mainly for KDE localization.

Each folder in this repository is a project. Currently the following projects are available:

_kdeProjectCreator_ - Creates a Lokalize project by cloning the localization files from the KDE SVN repository. 
It also provides scripts to update the files and copy the translations into the current system. 
The script is written in Turkish, but if you are interested, please contact me.

_tmx2tbx converter_ - Converts TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) files into TBX (TermBase eXchange) files.
TBX files are used in Lokalize for dictionary suggestions.
